# Smart_Calculator
This program is used for computing more advanced operations from the console. Input some expressions to calculate like in your school notebook. Smart_Calculator provides operations like adding, multiplication, division, subtraction, and power of numbers. You can use these operators to calculate the root of the number (if you are smart enough ;) ).

Idea
The idea of this program was born based on a project from the site https://hyperskill.org/. I changed some assumptions of the project to be more error-free and to be more advanced.

How to use it?
Just compile and run this program in the terminal and type some expressions. It's simple. Type your expression like in your math notebook! For example: (123 - 52)/18 - 6. Type "/exit" to terminate the program. Type "/help" to get more information about this app. You can assign value to a variable, type your variable name, and next use the "=" operator and your value to assign it. The app supports operations like addition "+", multiplication "*", subtraction "-", division "/", powers "^" and calculations in parentheses "()". The name of the variable only can have letters (case sensitive), digits and an underscore ("_"). Type "/rules" to get more information about variable naming rules. If you want to see your previous inputs, type "/history". If you want to see every variable you put in the program, type "/variables".

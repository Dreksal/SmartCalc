# Smart_Calculator
This program is used for computing more advanced operations from the console. Input some expressions to calculate like in your school notebook. Smart_Calculator provides operations like adding, multiplication, division, subtraction, and power of numbers. You can use these operators to calculate the root of the number (if you are smart enough ;) ). 

## Idea
The idea of this program was born based on a project from the site https://hyperskill.org/. I changed some assumptions of the project to be more error-free and to be more advanced.

## How to use it?
Just compile and run this program in the terminal and type some expressions. It's simple. Type your expression like in your math notebook! For example: (123 - 52)/18 - 6. Type "/exit" to terminate the program. Type "/help" to get more information about this app. You can assign value to a variable, type your variable name, and next use the "=" operator and your value to assign it. The app supports operations like addition "+", multiplication "*", subtraction "-", division "/", powers "^" and calculations in parentheses "()". The name of the variable only can have letters (case sensitive), digits and an underscore ("_"). Type "/rules" to get more information about variable naming rules. If you want to see your previous inputs, type "/history". If you want to see every variable you put in the program, type "/variables".
